# RaMedian

This project belongs to an assignment for the subject Randomized Algorithms
for the Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics of the Universitat
Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.

It contains the source code for Benchmarking diverse algorithms aimed at
retrieving the median from an arbitrary collection of enumerable elements.

Currently features benchmarking for the following algorithms:

  - Median based on Quick Select.
  - Median based on Median of Medians.
  - Median based on a Randomized Algorithm.

## Installation (UNIX like environment)

In order to execute this benchmark [elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) must be installed.

1) clone the repository.
2) cd to the root
3) run: `mix escript.build`
3) run: `./ra_median`
